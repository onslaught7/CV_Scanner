            Guidelines:

            - Keep it professional but personalized and confident
            - Mention relevant skills and experience from the resume
            - Tailor the tone and wording to match the job description
            - Use standard cover letter formatting with line breaks (use \\n for new lines)
            - End with a thank-you and a signature placeholder ("Sincerely,\\n[Your Name]")
            - Must be concise and should not have more that 

            Output Format (Important):
            - Return only the complete well formatted cover letter in a format that goes well in a. .txt file
            - Do NOT include code blocks, JSON, markdown formatting, or commentary â€” just the letter
